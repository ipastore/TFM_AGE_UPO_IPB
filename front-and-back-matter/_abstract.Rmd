It is undeniable that we are going through a globalized ecosocial crisis. Political agroecology proposes the transformation of the dominant agri-food regime as the most effective measure to navigate the crisis. Within the framework of a project funded by the European Joint Research Centre, 55 field interviews were conducted to understand farmers' perceptions of European Public Policies in the agricultural sector. Through statistical analysis, a diagnosis of the current regulatory framework was carried out, and conclusions were drawn to enhance the scope of Public Policies with a view to catalyzing the transition towards a new agroecologically based agri-food regime.
